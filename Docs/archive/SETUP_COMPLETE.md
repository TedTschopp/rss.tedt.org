- **Workflow Summaries**: Rich reporting for each run

### 4. Technical Stack
```
Frontend: Jekyll + Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome
Backend: Python (Enhanced Scraper + Monitor)
Deployment: GitHub Actions → GitHub Pages
Feeds: XML RSS 2.0 with health monitoring
```

## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
You'll need to enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
3. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/GitHub-Action-To-Read-Table-and-Convert-to-RSS`
4. (Optional) Set up custom domain `rss.tedt.org`

### 2. Test the Workflow
```bash
# Push changes to trigger deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Add Jekyll site with RSS feed hub"
git push origin main

# Or manually trigger the workflow
# Go to Actions tab → "RSS Feed Hub - Scrape and Deploy" → "Run workflow"
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
Once deployed, check:
- [ ] Site loads at your GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] RSS feed is accessible (`/ai_rss_feed.xml`)
- [ ] Status monitoring works (`/api/rss_status.json`)
- [ ] All pages render correctly (Home, Feeds, About)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works

## 📊 Site Features

### RSS Feed Display
- **Live Previews**: Latest 5 entries from each feed
- **Health Status**: Real-time monitoring with color-coded badges  
- **Direct RSS Links**: Easy subscription access
- **Entry Counts**: Shows total articles per feed

### Monitoring Dashboard
- **Feed Health**: Green/red status indicators
- **Last Updated**: Timestamps for feed freshness
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error messages when feeds fail
- **Statistics**: Quick stats sidebar with totals

### Mobile-First Design
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Fast Loading**: Minimal dependencies, CDN assets
- **Modern UI**: Clean Bootstrap 5 design
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## 🔧 Configuration

### Custom Domain (Optional)
To use `rss.tedt.org`:

1. Create `CNAME` file in repository root:
```
rss.tedt.org
```

2. Configure DNS:
```
CNAME rss.tedt.org yourusername.github.io
```

### Feed Configuration
Add/modify feeds in `_config.yml`:
```yaml
rss_feeds:
  - name: "New Feed"
    url: "/new_feed.xml"
    description: "Description of new feed"
```

### Styling Customization
The site uses inline CSS in `_layouts/default.html` for simplicity. For major customizations:

1. Create `assets/css/main.css`
2. Add custom styles
3. Link in layout template

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Jekyll Build Fails**: Check Ruby version and Gemfile dependencies
2. **RSS Not Loading**: Verify feed files exist and are valid XML
3. **JavaScript Errors**: Check browser console for CORS issues
4. **Deployment Fails**: Review GitHub Actions logs

### Debugging Steps
```bash
# Local Jekyll testing
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --watch

# Check RSS feed validity
curl -I https://your-site.com/ai_rss_feed.xml

# Test feed status API
curl https://your-site.com/api/rss_status.json
```
